    <h1>Top 3 Moroccan Dishes By me</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 Moroccan Dishes all-time.</h2>

    <h3>Tagine</h3>

    <p>Tagines are primarily used to slow-cook savory stews and vegetable dishes. Because the lid of the tagine traps steam and returns the condensed liquid to the pot, a minimal amount of water is needed to cook meats and vegetables to buttery tenderness. This method of cooking is very practical in areas where water supplies are limited or where public water is not yet available; it also helps tenderize inexpensive cuts of meat.</p>

    <h3>Couscous</h3>

    <p>Couscous is a special dish made every Friday in Moroccan homes. Typically the week’s leftover vegetables are used to make the stew for the couscous. Now, this isn’t a dish made by merely putting together meat and vegetables; a lot of love and effort is stewed into the broth.
        Traditionally couscous is steamed for hours in a special pot, called a Couscoussier. A rich broth of seasonal vegetables and meat is then prepared simultaneously.</p>

    <h3>Bastilla</h3>

    <p>Bastilla is one of Morocco’s most top dishes and is served on special holidays, at weddings, and birthday parties. Bastilla is round and comes in many sizes... 
        <br>Pastilla (or bastilla) is a savory chicken pie made with crispy, flaky phyllo dough and a tender shredded chicken filling, seasoned with warm North African flavors including Ras El Hanout, ginger, and cinnamon. You can make it in a skillet!
